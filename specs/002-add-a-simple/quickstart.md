# Quickstart: Hello Command

## Overview
This quickstart validates the hello command implementation by walking through the primary user scenarios defined in the feature specification.

## Prerequisites
- CLI tool built and available
- Node.js runtime environment
- Terminal/command line access

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Hello Command Execution
**User Story**: As a developer testing the spec-kit workflow, I need a simple hello command that I can run to verify the system is working.

**Steps**:
```bash
# Execute the hello command
specify hello

# Expected output: Friendly greeting message
# Expected behavior: Command completes successfully without errors
# Expected time: <10ms response time
```

**Validation**:
- ✅ Command executes without errors (exit code 0)
- ✅ Greeting message is displayed
- ✅ Message contains "hello" or similar greeting
- ✅ Execution completes quickly

### Scenario 2: Help Information Access
**User Story**: As a user, I want to see help information for the hello command.

**Steps**:
```bash
# Get help for hello command
specify hello --help

# Expected output: Help text describing the hello command
# Expected behavior: Command shows usage information
```

**Validation**:
- ✅ Help text is displayed
- ✅ Command description is clear
- ✅ Usage information is provided

### Scenario 3: Multiple Execution Consistency
**User Story**: As a developer, I want the hello command to work consistently across multiple runs.

**Steps**:
```bash
# Run hello command multiple times
specify hello
specify hello
specify hello

# Expected behavior: Each execution produces consistent output
```

**Validation**:
- ✅ All executions succeed
- ✅ Output format is consistent
- ✅ No errors or degradation across runs

## Validation Checklist
Use this checklist to verify the hello command meets all requirements:

### Functional Requirements Validation
- [ ] **FR-001**: System provides `hello` command via CLI ✓
- [ ] **FR-002**: System displays greeting message ✓
- [ ] **FR-003**: Users can run `specify hello` ✓
- [ ] **FR-004**: Command completes without errors ✓
- [ ] **FR-005**: Command serves as workflow test case ✓

### Acceptance Criteria Validation
- [ ] **AC-1**: CLI tool installed and hello command available
- [ ] **AC-2**: `specify hello` produces friendly greeting
- [ ] **AC-3**: Command execution completes successfully
- [ ] **AC-4**: Workflow pipeline can be verified using this feature

### Performance Validation
- [ ] Greeting response time <10ms
- [ ] Total CLI execution time <1000ms
- [ ] No memory leaks across multiple executions
- [ ] Consistent performance across runs

### Integration Validation
- [ ] Command integrates with existing CLI infrastructure
- [ ] Help system integration works properly
- [ ] Logging system captures command execution
- [ ] Error handling follows existing patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Command not found**: Ensure CLI tool is built and installed
2. **Permission errors**: Check file permissions on CLI executable
3. **Slow execution**: Verify no blocking operations in greeting generation
4. **Inconsistent output**: Check for stateful dependencies or timing issues

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check CLI tool version and available commands
specify --version
specify --help

# Verify hello command is registered
specify --help | grep hello

# Test CLI tool basic functionality
specify list-models  # or any other existing command
```

## Success Criteria
The hello command implementation is complete and successful when:
- All validation checklists pass ✅
- All test scenarios execute successfully ✅
- Performance requirements are met ✅
- Integration with existing CLI is seamless ✅
- Feature serves as effective workflow test case ✅
