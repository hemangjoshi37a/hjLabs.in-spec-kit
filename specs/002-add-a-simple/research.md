# Research: Add Simple Hello Command

## CLI Command Patterns

**Decision**: Use Commander.js command pattern with service layer architecture
**Rationale**:
- Existing project already uses Commander.js for CLI parsing
- Service layer separation maintains testability and follows constitutional library-first principle
- Simple hello command fits well into existing CLI architecture

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct console.log in command handler - rejected for poor testability
- Complex greeting service - rejected for violating simplicity principle

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Follow existing TDD pattern with contract → integration → unit test order
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle
- Existing test infrastructure supports Jest/similar framework
- Simple command allows full test coverage with minimal complexity

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual testing only - rejected due to constitutional testing requirements
- Mock-heavy unit testing - rejected in favor of integration testing with real CLI execution

## Implementation Approach

**Decision**: Create hello-service.ts in services/ and hello-command.ts in cli/
**Rationale**:
- Follows existing project structure
- Service layer enables library-first architecture
- CLI layer provides Commander.js integration
- Separation allows independent testing

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single file implementation - rejected for not following library-first principle
- Complex module structure - rejected for violating simplicity for this simple feature

## Performance Considerations

**Decision**: Direct string return with no async operations
**Rationale**:
- Hello command needs immediate response (<10ms)
- No external dependencies or I/O required
- Simple string concatenation meets performance goals

**Alternatives considered**:
- Template engine - rejected as overkill for simple greeting
- Configuration-based messages - rejected as unnecessary complexity

## Integration with Existing CLI

**Decision**: Add hello command to existing Commander.js program instance
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing command registration pattern
- Maintains single CLI entry point
- Supports --help and --version flags automatically

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate CLI binary - rejected for unnecessarily fragmenting user experience
- Subcommand structure - rejected as overkill for single hello command
