## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer testing the spec-kit workflow, I need a simple hello command that I can run to verify the `/specify`, `/plan`, and `/tasks` commands are working correctly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the CLI tool is installed, **When** I run `specify hello`, **Then** I receive a friendly greeting message
2. **Given** I run the hello command, **When** the command executes, **Then** it completes successfully without errors
3. **Given** I want to test the workflow, **When** I use this feature, **Then** I can verify the entire development pipeline works

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the hello command is run multiple times?
- How does the system handle when no additional arguments are provided?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a `hello` command that can be invoked via the CLI
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a greeting message when the hello command is executed
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to run `specify hello` from the command line
- **FR-004**: System MUST complete the hello command execution without errors
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide this command as a test case for the development workflow

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Greeting Message**: Simple text output that confirms the command is working
- **Command Response**: Success indicator that the workflow pipeline is functioning
