# Feature Specification: AI Model Switching and Task Tracking UI

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-model-switching`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "AI Model Switching and Task Tracking UI - Allow users to change AI models after initialization without losing progress, implement automatic project detection to avoid redundant init commands, add a visual task tracking sidebar showing completed, remaining, and failed tasks with real-time status updates"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: AI model switching, project state preservation, automatic detection, task tracking UI
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which AI models should be supported beyond Gemini and Claude?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What constitutes "previous progress" that must be preserved?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows identified for model switching and task tracking
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focused on testable capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities (project configuration, task states, AI model settings)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec has some uncertainties marked for clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer has initialized a spec-kit project with Gemini AI model but later wants to switch to Claude without losing their existing specifications, progress, and configurations. Additionally, they want visual feedback on task completion status while working with the CLI tool.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a project initialized with Gemini AI model, **When** user runs a model switch command to Claude, **Then** the system preserves all existing specifications and continues with Claude
2. **Given** a directory with existing spec-kit files, **When** user runs any spec-kit command, **Then** the system automatically detects the existing setup without requiring init
3. **Given** user is working with spec-kit commands, **When** tasks are executed, **Then** a sidebar displays real-time status of completed, remaining, and failed tasks
4. **Given** user wants to completely reset their AI model choice, **When** user runs a reset command, **Then** system provides clean removal and allows fresh initialization

### Edge Cases
- What happens when switching between incompatible AI model configurations?
- How does system handle corrupted or partially migrated project state?
- What occurs when task tracking UI encounters display constraints in terminal?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to switch AI models after project initialization without data loss
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically detect existing spec-kit projects and continue from current state
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve all specifications, configurations, and progress when changing AI models
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a visual task tracking interface showing task states (completed, remaining, failed)
- **FR-005**: System MUST update task status in real-time as commands execute
- **FR-006**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific AI models beyond Gemini and Claude?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clean project reset functionality for complete AI model changes
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate AI model compatibility before switching
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain task history across sessions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: persistence duration not specified]
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to view detailed task failure reasons when tasks fail
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle terminal display constraints gracefully for task tracking UI
- **FR-012**: System MUST migrate [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what specific data structures need migration between AI models?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project Configuration**: Stores current AI model, initialization state, and project metadata
- **Task Status**: Represents individual task states with completion status, timing, and error information
- **AI Model Settings**: Contains model-specific configurations and compatibility requirements
- **Migration State**: Tracks progress and status during AI model switching operations
